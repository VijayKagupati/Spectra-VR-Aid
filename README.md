## Overview

Children with ASD and ID often face challenges in social interactions, emotional regulation, and daily life tasks. **Spectra** addresses these challenges by offering:
- **Customizable VR Scenarios:** Tailored learning experiences that adapt to individual sensory and cognitive needs.
- **Real-Time Feedback:** Immediate guidance and analytics to help refine social cues and responses.
- **Inclusive Design:** A platform designed with both urban and rural settings in mind, featuring multi-language support.

Spectra not only focuses on skill development but also provides a safe and engaging environment where children can learn at their own pace.
